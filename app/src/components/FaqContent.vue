              <li>Take an ART self-test within 24 hours of your last contact with the person.</li>
              <li>Should you need to leave your home over the next 5 days, e.g. for work or to school, take an ART self-test on the same day. If negative, you can leave your home. If positive, follow protocol.</li>

          <p class="qns">How does MOH determine if someone is a close contact of a confirmed case?</p>

          <div class="ans">
            MOH conducts contact tracing to identify people who have been in contact with the confirmed case. 
            <ul>
              <li>A close contact is defined as someone who has spent 15 minutes or more within 2 metres of the infected individual.</li>
              <li>MOH also considers the nature and setting of exposure, type of personal protective equipment donned, and other clinical and epidemiological factors when assessing if follow up actions are required for the close contacts.</li>
              <li>Identified close contacts will be advised by MOH officials on the measures they should take.</li>
